	abstract = {Voter turnout theories based on rational self-interested behavior generally fail to predict significant turnout unless they account for the utility that citizens receive from performing their civic duty. We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility, intrinsic satisfaction from behaving in accordance with a norm and extrinsic incentives to comply, and test the effects of priming intrinsic motives and applying varying degrees of extrinsic pressure. A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects. Substantially higher turnout was observed among those who received mailings promising to publicize their turnout to their household or their neighbors. These findings demonstrate the profound importance of social pressure as an inducement to political participation.},

	abstract = {Research evidence suggests that communication is a powerful tool for influencing public opinion and attitudes toward various health-related issues, such as vaccine reluctance, provided it is well-designed and thoughtfully conducted. In particular, social marketing techniques that alter the target audience’s behaviors for the public good can substantially improve vaccine uptake if adopted as a communication strategy in immunization programs to counter public hesitancy. This study presents evidence from the Korean government’s current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign, which successfully applied a social marketing approach. By the end of August 2022, South Korea had achieved high vaccine coverage, with 94.8\% of the population (12+) receiving a second dose, 71.3\% a third dose, and a fourth dose drive currently underway. There are five crucial factors to consider when preparing official communication for an immunization program: (i) a high degree of proactiveness, (ii) credibility, (iii) fighting misinformation, (iv) emphasizing social norms and prosocial behavior, and (v) coherence. Although using social marketing strategies may not be successful in all circumstances, the lessons learned and current implementation in Korea suggest their efficacy in fostering vaccine acceptance. This study offers valuable insights for government agencies and global public health practitioners to develop effective targeted campaign strategies that enhance the target population’s vaccination intention.},

	abstract = {In an era where social media shapes public opinion, understanding information spreading is key to grasping its broader impact. This paper explores the intricacies of information diffusion on Twitter, emphasizing the significant influence of content saturation on user engagement and retweet behaviors. We introduce a diffusion model that quantifies the likelihood of retweeting relative to the number of accounts a user follows. Our findings reveal a significant negative correlation where users following many accounts are less likely to retweet, suggesting a saturation effect in which exposure to information overload reduces engagement. We validate our model through simulations, demonstrating its ability to replicate real-world retweet network characteristics, including diffusion size and structural properties. Additionally, we explore this saturation effect on the temporal behavior of retweets, revealing that retweet intervals follow a stretched exponential distribution, which better captures the gradual decline in engagement over time. Our results underscore the competitive nature of information diffusion in social networks, where tweets have short lifespans and are quickly replaced by new information. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of content propagation mechanisms, offering a model with broad applicability across contexts, and highlights the importance of information overload in structural and temporal social media dynamics.},

              There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi
              et al.
              used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed.

            A large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth.
          , 
            We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise {\textasciitilde}126,000 stories tweeted by {\textasciitilde}3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},
